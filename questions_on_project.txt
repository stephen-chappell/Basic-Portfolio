1. for the portfolio page, it looks like it might be 3x3 grid; should i do that or should i just do the five boxes pictures?

2. for the portfolio page - table or bootstrap?

3. html validation - container not allowed as child of body??

4. why is the container not shrinking to 960px?

5. use rows to make the grid and float within the row?
