                        Stephen is an Atlanta-based web development student at The Georgia Institute of Technology. His interests lie in server-side development and cybersecurity and he hopes to find a job at the crossroads of the two. Stephen has solid experience in HTML and CSS as well Adobe Cold Fusion, but is intrigued by Node.js and other server-side technologies. In the little spare time his program affords him, Stephen is working to build a home-based web server on a Raspberry-Pi machine.

                        In addition to coding and security, Stephen is an avid fly fisherman with a particular interest in rainbow trout, which he finds particularly delicious. As a former chef, Stephen is a proficient home cook with expertise in French, Italian and Japanese cuisines. At the moment he is working on developing a food blog emphasizing simple American/Asian fusion cuisine.
