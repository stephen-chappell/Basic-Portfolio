                    Stephen is an Atlanta-based web development student at The Georgia Institute of Technology. His
                    interests lie in server-side development and cybersecurity and he hopes to find a job at the
                    crossroads of the two. Stephen has solid experience in HTML and CSS as well as Adobe Cold Fusion, but
                    is intrigued by Node.js and other server-side technologies. In the little spare time his program
                    affords him, Stephen is working to build a home-based web server on a Raspberry-Pi machine.

                    In addition to coding and security, Stephen is an avid fly fisherman with a particular interest in
                    rainbow trout, which he finds particularly delicious. As a former chef, Stephen is a proficient home
                    cook with expertise in French, Italian and Japanese cuisines. At the moment he is working on
                    developing a food blog emphasizing simple American/Asian fusion cuisine.

                    Stephen also owns two cats (or rather, is owned by two cats), Daisy and Mrs. Patmore. Despite their
                    best efforts to destroy his home and possessions, Stephen is a dedicated kitty-daddy and even makes
                    homemade cat food for his girls.
